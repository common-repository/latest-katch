Latest Katch embeds the latest Periscope or Meerkat video from a Katch.me account into any page or post.

== Description ==

The Latest Katch plugin uses a WordPress shortcode to embed the latest video from a Katch.me feed into any page or post on your site. You can also specify a custom size for the video to display. Type [katch] where you want to embed the latest video. Simply install the plugin and enter your Katch.me username on the Settings page.

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin through the WordPress plugin screen directly or upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory on your site.
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ screen in WordPress.
3. Use the Settings->Latest Katch screen to specify your Katch.me username. You can also specify a custom size to display the video, if desired.
4. Type [katch] in the post or page where you want to display your latest Katch video. You can add other text or images before or after the [katch] shortcode.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use this plugin on multiple pages or posts on my site? =

Yes. However, if you attempt to use the plugin more than once on the same page or post, only one may load correctly.

= How often does the plugin update the latest video? =

Every time someone visits the page on your site that uses the plugin, it checks your Katch.me RSS feed for the latest video so it’s always up to date.

= Do I have to log into Katch in the plugin to be able to use it? =

No. Because Katch videos are publicly visible, a password is not required. You can even use the plugin to embed someone else’s Katch.me feed!

= What if my Katch.me username is different from my Periscope and/or Meerkat usernames? =

Enter the username you use for Katch.me in order for the plugin to find your videos correctly.
